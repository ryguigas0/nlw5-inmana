### Loss prevention by smart inventory management
- REST api
- Can add supplies and restaurants
- Can access supply information
  - Name of the product
  - Who produced it
  - When it was made (dd/mm/yyyy)
  - When it expires (dd/mm/yyyy)
  - Who is responsible for it
- Can generate a report on expiring items every week for each restaurant
- Can send a report to each restaurants email

## My challenges
- Restaurants inventories CRUD
  - Restaurants can have multiple supply inventories with names and locations
- Account CRUD
  - JWT tokens
  - Email confirmation
  - Restaurants can switch email, name and password with confirmation
- Same supplies, different expiration date
- Mobile-first web frontend
- Download as webapp
