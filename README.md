### Loss prevention by smart inventory management
- REST api
- Can add restaurants and ther supplies
- Can send an automatic report to each restaurants email of expiring items

## My challenges
- Backend
  - Make test files gradually
  - Account CRUD
    - JWT tokens
    - Email confirmation
    - Restaurants can switch email, name and password with confirmation
  - Add more supply info
    - When it was made (dd/mm/yyyy)
    - Name of the product
    - Who produced it
    - Location
- Frontend
